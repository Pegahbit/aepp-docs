# Welcome to the Ã†ternity Prototypes

We publish concepts and prototypes of Ã¦pps that will run on the Ã¦ternity blockchain. We work in with an iterative process that is build up by sprints, which last two weeks each. We document our progress and results per sprint. We encourage designers and developers to join the community.

ðŸ“± Our Ã¦pps are designed mobile first

ðŸ“– Everything we build is open source
